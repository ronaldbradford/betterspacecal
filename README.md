# SpaceCal NYC

[SpaceCalNYC](http://spacecalnyc.com/) is a full-featured replacement for myspacecal.com with better visualization of data and easier data export for scientists.

SpaceCal was developed for [NASA's Space App Challenge 2013](http://spaceappschallenge.org/).

## Background

We have a wealth of astronomical satellites from various organizations circling around the Earth staring at numerous astronomical targets. But on a given time, where do they exactly look at? Each satellite project has its own devoted time schedule retrievable from the web, giving information about observations done in the past, observations foreseen in the near-future (i.e., short-term), and observations foreseen in the far future (i.e., long-term). All have different ways and styles to retrieve and display the schedules. This makes it extremely cumbersome to see what a satellite is observing or did observe at a given time or will observe in the future; comparing schedules from different satellites are even harder.

## Challenge Description

Combine the past and future time schedules of satellites into a common calendar and make the information easily accessible. This can be done as an app or a website.
